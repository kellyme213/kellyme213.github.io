                <p> The Lonely Fisherman is part browser game, part Chrome extension. In the game, you fish with the lonely fisherman while he rambles about his life. However, if you leave the fisherman and go to other tabs (with the Chrome extension installed), he gets upset and tries to get you to come back by interfering with your web browsing experience. </p>
                
                <p> I was responsible for developing the 'front end' of the game. I programmed the rendering, animation, and gameplay code for the game. The game is written in vanilla JavaScript, and the game is rendered with an HTML canvas. I also did a bit of bugfixing on the 'back end' Chrome extension. The extension uses JQuery. </p>
