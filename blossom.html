            <h1> PyMEL Cherry Blossoms </h1>
            
            <p> For a 3D modeling project, I made a diorama scene (see my modeling page). For the project, I wanted to model a cherry blossom tree, but adding cherry blossoms to the tree was very tedious, so I only added a few to the tree. After I completed the project, I learned PyMEL so I could write a script to place cherry blossoms on my tree for me. The script copies a pre-modeled blossom, and places a few blossoms on each face of the tree, with each blossom having the same orientation as the face it is on. The blossoms are also randomly resized and rotated to add a more natural look. </p>
            
            <p>
            I used my script in a scene for my Lighting, Rendering,
            and Cinematography class. You can see more of my renders in my Lighting section.
            </p>
