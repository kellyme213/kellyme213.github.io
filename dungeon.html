        <p>
            The Dungeon is a top-down adventure game developed in Java. The player moves around
            the world with the arrow keys and attacks/interacts with objects by pressing the space bar.
            The game code uses a very rudimentary animation system that I wrote myself.

        </div>
        
        <p>
            After a few months, I rewrote the game engine to include other features, like multithreading,
            movable objects, and a level editor.
