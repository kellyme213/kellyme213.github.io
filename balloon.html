            <div class = "heading">
                <p> We developed a real-time balloon simulation application using a mass-spring simulation model and explicit Euler integrator. Our application reads in a user-specified quad mesh .obj file and generates a balloon with structural, shear, and flexion springs between the vertices of the balloon. Our application also allows the user to inflate and deflate the balloon in real time. Optionally, the user can apply a vertex position correction algorithm to the vertices to constrain the balloon's shape. Additionally, we implemented sphere-balloon collision detection so that the user
                can throw spheres at the balloon.
