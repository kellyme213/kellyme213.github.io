            <h1> Duality </h1>
            
            <p> Duality is a 2D co-op puzzle platformer developed by a five person team over four months. One player plays as a white character, and the other player plays as the black character. The black character can only go in bright areas, and the white character can only go in dark areas. Players must work together to complete the levels and solve the mystery of their situation. </p>
            
            <p> For the project, I developed all of the 3D models, some of the background object textures, and wrote a bit of gameplay code. I also created initial level designs and helped create the end cutscene, along with code to move the camera around our cutscene. Our game was made in Unity. </p>
