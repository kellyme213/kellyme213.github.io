    Hi! My name is Michael Kelly. Thank you so much for visiting my portfolio website.
</p>



<p>

Since middle school, I have been programming and designing games for many devices, from calculators to iPhones.

</p>

<p>

During the past few summers, I interned at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. At the Naval Research Laboratory, I developed analysis software for a seabed penetrometer. A seabed penetrometer is used to determine bearing strength, a measurement that has uses is mine detection and underwater construction. My custom analysis software replaced outdated software and provides researchers groundwork on which to add more software features.

Two of my recent projects, <i>Connect the Shapes!</i> and <i>OXIO</i>, earned me a ticket to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 and 2017. Both of these games are developed using SpriteKit, Apple's 2D games API.
</p>

<p>
Thank you so much for your time.
