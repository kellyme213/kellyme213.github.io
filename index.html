    Since middle school, I have been programming and designing games for a multitude of devices, from calculators to iPhones.

</p>

<p>



During the past few summers, I have been an intern at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. At the Naval Research Laboratory, I developed analysis software for a seabed penetrometer. A seabed penetrometer is used to determine bearing strength, a measurement that has uses is mine detection and underwater construction. My custom analysis software replaces outdated software and provides researchers a groundwork on which to add more software features.

Two of my recent projects, <i>Connect the Shapes!</i> and <i>OXIO</i>, earned me a ticket to Apple's
Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 and 2017. At WWDC, I was given a glimpse at cutting-edge technology that I have implemented into my own software. Both of these games are developed using SpriteKit, Apple's 2D games API.
