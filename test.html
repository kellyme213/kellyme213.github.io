            		<p> This project achieves real-time GPU photon mapping by turning photons into small triangles and using Metal's ray tracing library to gather the photons. Metal uses a BVH to store triangles for GPU ray tracing. By turning photon points into photon triangles, the photon map can utilize the BVH to enable photon gathering on the GPU. Photons are gathered via ray casts that originate in a square above the photon gather point. If a photon gather ray intersects with a photon triangle, that photon is gathered. Then, compute shaders aggregate the gathered photons into a caustic texture, which contains the contribution of the photons to the indirect lighting of the scene. This texture is combined with the direct lighting texture computed by the rest of the path tracer to create the final rendered image. </p>
