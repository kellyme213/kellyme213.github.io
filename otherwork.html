            <p>
            As a final project for my AP Japanese class, I developed a Japanese Trivia app
            to review vocabulary. The user is able to select various levels of difficulty
            and the number of questions to answer. This app utilizes Apple's SpriteKit and
            runs on iOS.

        <div class = "heading">
            <p>
            Developed as a final project for AP Calculus, my graphing app takes a user-defined
            polar function and graphs it. The user can then move, rotate, and magnify multiple functions
            to create a pretty picture. This iOS app uses SpriteKit and UIKit.

                To show off my other projects, I developed a portfolio website. The website you are
                currently looking at isn't actually my real portfolio. It is fake. My real portfolio is
                linked below.
