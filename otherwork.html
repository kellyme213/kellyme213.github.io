                <p>
                As a final project for my AP Japanese class, I developed a Japanese Trivia app
                to review vocabulary. The user is able to select various levels of difficulty
                and the number of questions to answer. This app utilizes Apple's SpriteKit and
                runs on iOS.

                <p>
                Developed as a final project for AP Calculus, my graphing app takes a user-defined
                polar function and graphs it. The user can then move, rotate, and magnify multiple functions
                to create a pretty picture. This iOS app uses SpriteKit and UIKit.

                To show off my other projects, I developed a portfolio website. The website you are
