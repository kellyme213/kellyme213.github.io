            <p> I imagined the big crabs as a group of bullies who are surrounding the smaller crab to beat him up. I wanted the little crab to feel trapped by the big crabs, so I put a wall behind the small crab to solidify the fact that the small crab has nowhere to go. The frame imbalance also conveys that the big crabs have moved in to trap the small crab. I used a single light in the scene, positioned above the small crab. This causes the shadows of the big crabs to be large and dark, which makes them more menacing.

            <p> I wanted to capture a more uneasy vibe (think vampires, warewolves, gothic architecture, dark forests), so I used a lot of purples and reds. To add to the uneasiness, I placed the moon lower in the frame than the tree branch, since the moon is usually the highest thing in the sky. This makes it feel like the world is upside-down and something is not quite right in this world. If I were to improve this shot, I would make the branches skinnier, decrease the depth of field effect, and incorporate the moon into the scene better. This shot also used a PyMEL script to generate the cherry blossoms. See 'PyMEL Cherry Blossoms' for more details.
