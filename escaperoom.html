            <h1> Pandora's Box </h1>
            <!--<p> Pandora's Box is an escape room game developed utilising a <a style = "text-decoration:none;color:var(--siteColor);" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment">CAVE<a/>. The CAVE uses object motion tracking and wall projectors to create an immersive virtual environment. Our escape room takes place in a modern art museum with Greek artifacts. Players have 30 minutes to steal Pandora's Box from the museum. We used the motion tracking and projectors in the CAVE to create puzzles that are unlike puzzles in other escape rooms. </p>-->

            <p> <i>Pandora's Box</i> is a mixed reality escape room built in a <a style = "text-decoration:none;color:var(--siteColor);" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment">CAVE<a/>. The room utilizes motion-capture technology that allows for puzzles that standard escape rooms have yet to capture. </p>

            <p> In <i>Pandora's Box</i>, you play as a group of four thieves who have just broken into The Contemporary Greek Museum, a newly-founded gallery showcasing personal collections that provide fresh takes on the ancient Greek mythos. Your goal: infiltrate the museum and steal Pandora's Box. To do that, you'll need to find your way around an elaborate security system interwoven into the exhibits themselves. Luckily, you all came prepared with your patented Top Hat Technology&#8482; to buy you some time. You have 30 minutes before security catches on. Good luck! </p>

            <p> I designed most of the physical puzzles and room layout, and also programmed some of the digital puzzles. </p>

            		These puzzles are supposed to be solved by multiple people, but due to a certain global pandemic, I was not able to get players to playtest them :(.
