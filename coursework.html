                <a> Game Development 2 </a>
                <p> I worked in a group of five to develop a single game over the semester. Our team made Duality, a 2D platforming co-op game. One player plays as a white character, and the other player is a black character. The white character can only go in dark areas, and the black character can only go in bright areas. I worked on 3D modeling, level design, texturing, cutscene development, and some programming. </p>

                <a> Digital Filmmaking </a>
                <p> Students who take this class learn to make videos using lightweight video cameras, tripods, portable lighting kits, and a variety of microphones. They will leave the class understanding basic rules of composition for individual shots, basic sound recording for film and video, as well as the language of cinema editing including styles ranging from continuity to montage. The students will understand and be able to use multi-track video editing software and will be able to create dynamic relationships between sound and image. The student will know pre-production skills including basic scripting and storyboarding. Students will develop their critical capacity relative to analyzing cinema, video art, and emerging time-based media, and will acquire a basic knowledge of film history dating from the 1890's to the present. Students will also enhance their ability to work in teams on media projects and will learn about contemporary media practices and distribution. </p>
