            <a> Data Structures </a>
            <p> In Data Structures, I learned about pointers, arrays, templated classes, vectors, linked lists, trees, iterators, stacks, queues, associative containers, recursion, and order notation. The class was taught using C++ standard libraries. </p>

            <a> History and Culture of Games </a>
            <p> In History and Culture of Games, I examined games through a cultural lense and studied topics such as play, the power of roles, identity, and automation. I played various educational and serious games and studied their embedded values. At the end of the course, I wrote a research paper about violence in video games.</p>
