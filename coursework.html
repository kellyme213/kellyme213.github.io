                <a> Game Development 2 </a>
                <p> Students work in interdisciplinary teams to create one large-scale 3D game, working from concept to public release. Projects may include games, educational games, serious games and simulations, and interactive artworks, and will focus on creative design, technical execution, and use of game design principles.  </p>

                <a> Virtual Reality Projects </a>
                <p> In this project course, we will work with contemporary VR technologies including the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the CAVE. Projects will be open ended, can be team-based, and may take many forms including artworks, performances, games, educational simulations, or visualization/sonification. Readings, screenings, lectures and discussions will explore virtuality and immersion from the perspectives of philosophy, theory, technology and user experience. </p>
