            <a> History and Culture of Games </a>
            <p> In History and Culture of Games, I examined games through a cultural lense and studied topics such as play, the power of roles, identity, and automation. I played various educational and serious games and studied their embedded values. At the end of the course, I wrote a research paper about violence in video games.</p>

             <a> Game Development 1 </a>
             <p> This class is a practical primer for anyone interested in a career in the rapidly evolving industry of video gaming. It is an intense, team-based, project-based course in which students will closely follow the actual game development cycle, with each team producing a complete PC game. </p>

         <div class = "heading">
             <a> Intro to Algorithms </a>
             <p> In Intro to Algorithms, I learned about Data structures and algorithms, and the mathematical techniques necessary to design and analyze them. Basic data structures: lists, associative structures, trees. Mathematical techniques for designing algorithms and analyzing worst-case and expected-case algorithm efficiency. Advanced data structures: balanced trees, tries, heaps, priority queues, graphs. Searching, sorting. Algorithm design techniques: dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, backtracking. Example graph, string, geometric, and numeric algorithms. </p>

         <div class = "heading">
             <a> Computer Graphics </a>
             <p> Introduction to Interactive Computer Graphics, with an emphasis on applications programming. Objects and viewers, and the synthetic camera model. Graphics architectures, the graphics pipeline, clipping, rasterization, and programmable shaders. Input and interaction. Geometric objects, homogeneous coordinates, and transformations. Viewing, hidden surface removal, frame and depth buffers, compositing, and anti-aliasing. Shading, light and materials, texture mapping, ray tracing, and radiosity. Intellectual property concerns. Extensive programming with the OpenGL API and C++. </p>

             <a> Art for Interactive Media </a>
             <p> This course combines an introduction to traditional visual arts and digital media and serves as a foundation for work in game design and interactive art. Using studio projects that incorporate physical media, digital imaging and computer code, students develop their formal vocabulary, observational skills, and their understanding of issues in visual and interactive arts. </p>
         </div>
         
         <div class = "heading">
             <a> Principles of Software </a>
             <p> A study of important concepts in software design, implementation, and testing. Topics include specification, abstraction with classes, design principles and patterns, testing, refactoring, the software development process, GUI and event-driven programming, and cloud-based programming. The course also introduces implementation and testing tools, including IDEs, revision control systems, and other frameworks. The overarching goal of the course is for students to learn how to write correct and maintainable software. </p>
