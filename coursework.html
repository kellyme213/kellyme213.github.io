                <p> In this project course, we will work with contemporary VR technologies including the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the CAVE. Projects will be open ended, can be team-based, and may take many forms including artworks, performances, games, educational simulations, or visualization/sonification. Readings, screenings, lectures and discussions will explore virtuality and immersion from the perspectives of philosophy, theory, technology and user experience. </p>
