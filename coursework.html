                <a> Fun with Cameras, Maya, and AR </a>
                <p> This independent study will involve creating an AR app and Maya plugin. Users of the app will model a scene in Maya, export the model and import it in the AR app. Then, the user will display the model in augmented reality and record the position and orientation of the phone as it moves around in 3D space. Then, the app will export camera position data, and the Maya plugin will import the data. </p>

                <p> Students who take this class learn to make videos using lightweight video cameras, tripods, portable lighting kits, and a variety of microphones. They will leave the class understanding basic rules of composition for individual shots, basic sound recording for film and video, as well as the language of cinema editing including styles ranging from continuity to montage. The students will understand and be able to use multi-track video editing software and will be able to create dynamic relationships between sound and image. The student will know pre-production skills including basic scripting and storyboarding. Students will develop their critical capacity relative to analyzing cinema, video art, and emerging time-based media, and will acquire a basic knowledge of film history dating from the 1890's to the present. Students will also enhance their ability to work in teams on media projects and will learn about contemporary media practices and distribution. </p>
