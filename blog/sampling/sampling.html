            <h2> Riemann Sums </h2>

            <p> Before we talk about sampling, let's talk about integrals. Integrals are all about finding the area under a curve. How do we find the area under a curve. Some functions are easy to integrate, the integral can be written in a closed form and we can solve for the exact area under the curve. However, some functions cannot be integraled easily, and we have to solve them analytically. This will allow us to approximate the integral's solution. One way to approximate the integral is to draw rectangles under the funciton, then add up the areas of the triangles to get an approximation. </p>

                    <p> <b>The graph of y = 3x<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 1.</b> </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p> If you play around with the graph above, you can visually see how to approximate an integral. As the number of rectangles increases, the approximation gets better. In fact, as the number of rectangles used approaches infinity, the approximation approaches the exact solution! This type of approximation is typically reffered to as a Riemann sum. </p>

            <p> <b> Riemann sum equation picture </b> </p>

            <h2> Random Sampling </h2>

            <p> But is there a different way to approximate the integral? Instead of evaluating the function at evenly spaced points on the curve, what if we evaluate at randomly selected points? Let's try it! </p>

            <p> Since we aren't evaluating the function at even intervals anymore, the rectangles overlap in the visualization, so you can check the 'Align Rectangles' box to align the rectangles like in the first visualization. </p>

            <p> The randomly sampled integral estimation gives a slightly different result than the Riemann sum. Like the Riemann sum, the random approximation gets better as the number of samples increases. However, the random approximation varies in how accurate it is. Sometimes the random approximation is closer than the Reimann sum to the true value, sometimes it is further away. </p>

            <p> Based on the graph, we see that the variance of the riemann sum is always smaller than the variance of the random samples. :(. But, can we do better? Of course we can! <b> Maybe do a graph of number of samples vs % of approximations smaller than riemann error. </b></p>

            <p> As you can see, stratified sampling reduces the clumping and empty spots we see in random sampling. There are a few disadvantages though. THe number of stratified samples must be a multiple of the number of regions that we sample from. This is to ensure that the random samples are uniformly distributed across each region. If there were certain regions that contain more samples than others, we would be <i> biasing </i> the points towards specifc areas of the sample space (more on biasing later). Additionally, if certain sectoins had more points than others, we would start running into the same clumping issues we were trying to avoid from rando sampling. </p>

            <p> In fact, there is some bias in our Riemann sum. <b> add more talking about how high frequency functions are not well approximated by Riemann </b> </p>

            <h2> Importance Sampling </h2>

            <p> So far, we've been generating random samples that are evenly distributed over the interval from 0 to 1. In other words, each random value was equally likely to appear. What if we change this, so that some values are more likely to appear than others? This leads us to the idea of Probability Distribution Functions, or PDFs. A PDF is a function that describes the relative likelyhood that a random value is chosen. So far, we've been using a uniform PDF, so that all numbers are equally likely to appear. Before we construct a new PDF, let's talk about some properties of PDFs. </p>

            <p> <b> Bullets </b> PDF is defined over the interval [0, 1]. The integral of the PDF from 0 to 1 = 1 (normalized PDF).</p>

            <p> We can take the integral of a PDF to obtain a CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function. While PDF(x) defines the relative probability of x being selected, CDF(x) is the amount of samples less than x that are generated. CDF(0) = 0, PDF(1) = 1. </p>

            <p> We've currently been using a PDF of y = 1. Let's define a PDF of y = 2x. How do we generate numbers to follow the PDF? We will use Inverse Transorm Sampling.</p>

            <p> 1. create a normalized PDF, y = PDF(x). 2. Create the CDF, y = CDF(x). 3. Invert the CDF y = CDF-1(x). 4. Generate a random sample from a uniform PDF, u. plug in u into CDF-1, the output will be distributed along the PDF.</p>

            <p> As an example, let's use y = 2x as a PDF. The integral of 2x is x2. The inverse of x2 is sqrt(x). So, if we generate a random number u, sqrt(u) will be distributed along the PDF. Unfortunately, not all PDFs can be easily inverted like this, so we have to do approximations in that case, which is much more expensive than the y = 2x case. However, it can be done. </p>

            <p> A few things about selecting a PDF to use. We want the shape of the PDF to closely match the shape of the fuction that is being approximated. The closer the shapes, the better the approximation will be. Conversely, choosing a pdf with a shape that does not closely match the function will result in poor approximations. Additionally, if we have a separable function, like y = f(x) * g(x), using either f(x) or g(x) as the PDF will lead to good results. </p>

            <p> So, can we just start generating samples with our fancy new PDF/CDF and expect goos results? Almost. One last thing to consider. Our pdf will cause samples to be more or less dense now. In areas where samples are more dense, each rectangle generated should have a smaller width, since there are more samples to better approximate the dense area. Likewise, in areas of less density, the width of the rectangles should decrease, since that rectangle needs to approximate more of the function since fewer samples will be in that area. But how much to we scale these widths by? The value of the PDF at the random sample point. This leads to the following equation: </p>

            <p> With all this in mind, lets try using importance sampling on a seperable equation and see what happens! </p>

            <p> Hooray! With importance sampling, we are able to get an approximation with a lower variance than our Riemann sum! talk about different lines, how riemann eventualy gets better, but on higher dimentional functions and high frequency functions this will take longer than ~50 samples to occur, so importance sampling is a general purpose way to consistently get a better result with a decent number of samples. </p>
