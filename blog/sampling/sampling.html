            <p> Before we talk about sampling, let's talk about integrals. Integrals are all about finding the area under a curve. How do we find the area under a curve. Some functions are easy to integrate, the integral can be written in a closed form and we can solve for the exact area under the curve. However, some functions cannot be integraled easily, and we have to solve them analytically. This will allow us to approximate the integral's solution. One way to approximate the integral is to draw rectangles under the funciton, then add up the areas of the triangles to get an approximation. </p>

                    <canvas width = "1000px" height = "1000px" id = "canvas1"> </canvas>
                </div>
                <div class = "splitContent rightSplitContent noRight">
                    <p> <b>The graph of y = 3x<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 1.</b> </p>
                    <p> Exact Area: 1.0 </p>
                    <p id = "label1a"> Approximated Area: </p>
                    <p id = "label1b"> Difference: </p>
                    <p id = "label1c"> Number of Rectangles: </p>
                    <br/>
                    <input type = "range" id = "slider1" min = "1" max = "500" value = "10"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> If you play around with the graph above, you can visually see how to approximate an integral. As the number of rectangles increases, the approximation gets better. In fact, as the number of rectangles used approaches infinity, the approximation approaches the exact solution! This type of approximation is typically reffered to as a Riemann sum. </p>


            <p> But is there a different way to approximate the integral? Instead of evaluating the function at evenly spaced points on the curve, what if we evaluate at randomly selected points? Let's try it! </p>



            <div class = "graph">
                <div class = "splitContent leftSplitContent noLeft">

                    <p> <b>The graph of y = 3x<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 1 with random samples.</b> </p>

                    <p id = "label2b"> Difference: </p>

                    <input class = "slider" type = "range" id = "slider2" min = "1" max = "500" value = "10"/>

                        <label for = "check2" style = "padding-right: 10px"> Align Rectangles </label>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <div style="width = 100%; text-align: center;">
                        <button type = "button" name = "button2" id = "button2" style = "width: 150px"> Evaluate Integral </button>

                </div>
            </div>


            <p> Since we aren't evaluating the function at even intervals anymore, the rectangles overlap in the visualization, so you can check the 'Align Rectangles' box to align the rectangles like in the first visualization. </p>

            <p> The randomly sampled integral estimation gives a slightly different result than the Riemann sum. Like the Riemann sum, the random approximation gets better as the number of samples increases. However, the random approximation varies in how accurate it is. Sometimes the random approximation is closer than the Reimann sum to the true value, sometimes it is further away. </p>


            <p> This error can be visualized using a historgram. </p>
