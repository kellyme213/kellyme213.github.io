            <h1> Intro to Sampling </h1>

            <p> Hello! This article will introduce you to the concept of sampling- starting with Riemann sums, then moving on to uniform sampling, stratified sampling, and finishing with importance sampling. This article will explain sampling through a combination of text and interactive visual demos. If you're interested in a rigourous mathematical introduction to sampling, you may want to look elsewhere. But, if you like interactive demos, you've come to the right place! Before you begin reading, I suggest you have a good understanding of how to graph and evaluate functions. If you've taken late high school or early college level math, you should be fine. </p>

            <p> <i> Let's get started! </i> </p>

            <h2> Riemann sums </h2>

            <p> Before we talk about sampling, let's talk about integrals. We typically think of an integral as the "area under a curve", specifically the area between the function curve and the x-axis. Some functions are easy to integrate; we can write a nice formula to determine the exact area under a curve. However, some functions cannot be easily integrated, and we have to evaluate them analytically. By solving an integral analytically, we get an approximation of the integral. There are multiple ways to analytically solve an integral, but we will focus on a simple way called a Riemann sum. In a Riemann sum, we evaluate a function at evenly spaced points along the curve, then draw a rectangle with the height of the evaluated point. We calculate the area of each rectangle, sum the areas, and we get an approximation for the integral. Let's see what this looks like visually. </p>


            <div class = "graphContainer">
                <div class = "graph">
                    <canvas width = "1000px" height = "1000px" id = "canvas1"> </canvas>
                </div>
                <div class = "graphControls">
                    <p> <b>Riemann sum of y = 3x<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 1.</b> </p>
                    <p> Exact Area: 1.0 </p>
                    <p id = "label1a"> </p>
                    <p id = "label1b"> </p>
                    <p id = "label1c"> </p>
                    <br/>
                    <input class = "slider" type = "range" id = "slider1" min = "1" max = "500" value = "10"/>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> If you tinker with the graph above, you can visually see how to approximate an integral with a Riemann sum. As the number of rectangles increases, the approximation gets better and better, and the error in the approximation is reduced. </p>


            <h2> Random Sampling </h2>

            <p> But is there a different way to approximate the integral? Instead of evaluating the function at evenly spaced points on the curve, what if we evaluate at randomly selected points? Let's try it! </p>

                            <label for = "check2"> Align Rectangles </label>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <div style="width = 100%; text-align: center;">

                    </div>
                    <p> <i>Since the function isn't evaluated at evenly spaced intervals, the rectangles overlap, so you can check the 'Align Rectangles' box to align the rectangles and eliminate the overlap like in the first visualization.</i> </p>
                </div>
            </div>




            <p> The randomly sampled integral estimation yields a slightly different result than the Riemann sum. Like the Riemann sum, the random approximation gets better as the number of rectangles (also called samples) increases. However, the randomly approximated area is different each time you evaluate the integral. This causes the error in the approximation to vary as well. In fact, sometimes the random approximation error is smaller than the Reimann sum error, sometimes it is larger. </p>


            <p> Let's visualize the error terms in a histogram. The histogram will show the errors generated from approximating the integral many times. </p>

            </div>

            <p> You may notice that at a low number of samples per approximation, there is a large variation in the error terms. As the number of samples is increased, the errors converge towards 0 and there is much less variation. This 'variation' actually has a name - variance. Broadly speaking, variance is a measurement of how spread out a group of numbers is from the average value of the group. We can see that the variance in the error terms decreases towards 0 as the number of samples increases. In this case, a variance of 0 means that the random approximation is equal to the exact value of the integral, which is what we want. We can also apply this idea of variance to our Riemann sum approximation, since there is an error term in that approximation as well. In fact, we can compare the variances of the two sampling methods, and then use the method with the smaller variance to perform our approximations. <p>

            <p> <i> Side note - you may notice that the errors in the histogram mostly fit inside of a curve. This curve is called a normal/Gaussian distribution. The formula for producing a Gaussian distribution includes a variance term. </i> </p>

            <p> Based on the graph, we see that the variance of the riemann sum is always smaller than the variance of the random samples. This means that our Riemann Sum approximation is generally better than our random sampling strategy. However, even though Riemann has a smaller variance, we could still get lucky and run into a case where random is better than Riemann. If you look at the second graph, you can see the probability that random sampling has a smaller error than Riemann. You'll see that the random sampling has less than 30% chance of a better approximation once the sample count is larger than 20. Those are not good odds. :(. But, can we do better? Of course we can! </p>

            <h2> Stratified sampling </h2>

            <p> Let's take a slight detour to talk about Stratified Sampling. You may have noticed that in random sampling, there are cases where the random samples clump together, leaving large gaps in the interval. Usually, we do not like large gaps. We want our samples to be randomly distributed, but not clumped. How can we avoid this? With Stratified Sampling! In Stratified Sampling, we split the interval into smaller subintervals, then generate random samples in each of the subintervals. In our case, we will make sure that all the subintervals are the same size, but you could do stratified sampling with unevenly sized subintervals. </p>

            <p> As you can see, stratified sampling reduces the clumping and empty spots we see in random sampling. There are a few disadvantages though. THe number of stratified samples must be a multiple of the number of regions that we sample from. This is to ensure that the random samples are uniformly distributed across each region. If there were certain regions that contain more samples than others, we would be <i> biasing </i> the points towards specifc areas of the sample space (more on biasing later). Additionally, if certain sectoins had more points than others, we would start running into the same clumping issues we were trying to avoid from rando sampling. </p>

            <p> In fact, there is some bias in our Riemann sum. <b> add more talking about how high frequency functions are not well approximated by Riemann </b> </p>

            <p> Talk about red line, high frequency function and riemann bias cause it, stratified doesnt really make a difference in this function, both are about the same variance.</p>

            <h2> Importance Sampling </h2>

            <p> So far, we've been generating random samples that are evenly distributed over the interval from 0 to 1. In other words, each random value was equally likely to appear. What if we change this, so that some values are more likely to appear than others? This leads us to the idea of Probability Distribution Functions, or PDFs. A PDF is a function that describes the relative likelyhood that a random value is chosen. So far, we've been using a uniform PDF, so that all numbers are equally likely to appear. Before we construct a new PDF, let's talk about some properties of PDFs. </p>

            <p> <b> Bullets </b> PDF is defined over the interval [0, 1]. The integral of the PDF from 0 to 1 = 1 (normalized PDF).</p>

            <p> We can take the integral of a PDF to obtain a CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function. While PDF(x) defines the relative probability of x being selected, CDF(x) is the amount of samples less than x that are generated. CDF(0) = 0, PDF(1) = 1. </p>

            <p> We've currently been using a PDF of y = 1. Let's define a PDF of y = 2x. How do we generate numbers to follow the PDF? We will use Inverse Transorm Sampling.</p>

            <p> 1. create a normalized PDF, y = PDF(x). 2. Create the CDF, y = CDF(x). 3. Invert the CDF y = CDF-1(x). 4. Generate a random sample from a uniform PDF, u. plug in u into CDF-1, the output will be distributed along the PDF.</p>

            <p> As an example, let's use y = 2x as a PDF. The integral of 2x is x2. The inverse of x2 is sqrt(x). So, if we generate a random number u, sqrt(u) will be distributed along the PDF. Unfortunately, not all PDFs can be easily inverted like this, so we have to do approximations in that case, which is much more expensive than the y = 2x case. However, it can be done. </p>

            <p> A few things about selecting a PDF to use. We want the shape of the PDF to closely match the shape of the fuction that is being approximated. The closer the shapes, the better the approximation will be. Conversely, choosing a pdf with a shape that does not closely match the function will result in poor approximations. Additionally, if we have a separable function, like y = f(x) * g(x), using either f(x) or g(x) as the PDF will lead to good results. </p>

            <p> So, can we just start generating samples with our fancy new PDF/CDF and expect goos results? Almost. One last thing to consider. Our pdf will cause samples to be more or less dense now. In areas where samples are more dense, each rectangle generated should have a smaller width, since there are more samples to better approximate the dense area. Likewise, in areas of less density, the width of the rectangles should decrease, since that rectangle needs to approximate more of the function since fewer samples will be in that area. But how much to we scale these widths by? The value of the PDF at the random sample point. This leads to the following equation: </p>

            <p> Hooray! With importance sampling, we are able to get an approximation with a lower variance than our Riemann sum! Also, if you look at the probability graph, you'll notice that importance sampling has a 99% chance of producing a closer approximation than Riemann when there are less than 20 samples! Additionally, while uniform sampling drops down to around 10% at 200 samples, importance sampling is around 50%. You may also notice that our third PDF does a <i>terrible</i> job of approximating the function; it has a variance that bottoms out around 50, and a probability of better appximation that drops to 0% almost instantly. </p>

            <p> In this specific case, importance sampling is almost always better when the sample count less than 20 samples. On higher dimensional functions, this '20' number will increase, since higher dimensional functions generally require more samples to accurately approximate. Because of this, we should use importance sampling wherever possible. </p>


            <h2> Applications of Importance sampling</h2>
            <p> Importance sampling has many applications in the computer graphics field, mostly within ray tracing. Specifically, we use importance sampling when solving the rendering equation. Sometimes we use cosine-weighted importance sampling, which used y = cos(x) as the PDF. Other times we use BRDF importance sampling, where the BRDF of the material (or parts of it) is the PDF. In other cases, we need to use multiple PDFs to efficiently sample an integral. This is called multiple importance sampling, and it's a topic for another day :). </p>

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            <p> Sampling is a pretty useful technique for evaluating integrals. I hope you enjoyed the demos and learned something new! </p>
