            <p>
            <i>Connect the Shapes!</i> is a cross between a match-three game and connect the dots.
            Shapes are cleared from the board when they are linked together with shapes of the same
            type. If a shape is surrounded by a box of the same color, the player get a bonus.
            <i> Connect the Shapes! </i> is available on the App Store.

            <p>
            A demo version of <i>Connect the Shapes!</i> earned me a ticket to Apple's 2016
            Worldwide Developers Conference.
