            <p> All devs have made things that are just total piles of doo doo. Rather than hide it (like I'm doing right now because this page is <i>supposed</i> to be hidden), I am embracing the crap I've made. So here is a list of all the god-awful stuff I've made, starting from my high school years up through present day. </p>

            <h1 class = "resumeHeading"> The Wonderful Trap and Smuggle Game </h1>
            <p> Don't you just love the name? I came up with it. Come to me for advice on what to call your next game. </p>
            <ul class = "imagelist">

            </ul>
            
            <p> This was the very first game I made with other people. It was also my first game that I made for a class. You'll be happy to know that our game was the worst game in the class by far. But somehow I ended up with a 78 for my grade which, hey, I'll take it. The engine was 'intersting' (lolololol I called a piece of software 'interesting' to describe its API structure aren't I a funny software developer?). We used HaxeFlixel.</p>
            
            <p> I was a 'programmer' on the game (there were like 3 programmers and 0 artists). I did such useful things as: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <p> Wrote code with such helpful comments as '//the magic reflection formula.' </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Light beam reflection algorithm, which actually worked pretty decently </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Path movement algorithm for the guards </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Concept of the game (I was the ideas guy. And they said ideas guy wasn't a job in games smh). We picked three verbs from a deck of cards and had to base the game on two of the verbs. The third verbs was apprehend, in case you were curious. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Title and text in the game </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Some last minute hacks like doing a total bulls&#X1F4A9;&#X1F4A9;t read of the level data to place the mirrors. The level data was basically read in as a CSV and the value of the CSV indicated the tile id that went at that tile location. The mirrors were on a separate layer, so for that layer, I read in the CSV as an array, looped through the array, and when I found the value for the mirror (which I hardcoded into the code), I placed a mirror at that tile location. If the mirror tile id magically decided to change one day, would my code have worked? Absolutely not. Did HaxeFlixel have built in stuff that couldv'e probably placed the mirrors for me nicely? Probably. But when it was the night before the game was due and we barely had two levels made for the game, this is the kind of BS you pull. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Speaking of BS, I also hardcoded in the movement of the guards in the game. Since we had two levels, we made two nearly identical PlayState classes that just contained the guard movements. Who needs to parse data files when you can just hardcode stuff? </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Player of the game when we presented. I hold the world record for the Any% speed run.</p> </li>
                <li> <p> Other random things that aren't important </p> </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> At this point we should probably talk about the game. You play as a robber in a museum who is trying to steal its jewels. In order to get the jewels out of their cases, you have to trap the light beam in the case to open it, then you can smuggle the jewel past the guards and out of the museum. While making this game, I tested using a very slow macOS test emulator. This means that everything (the guards, player, and framerate) move verrrrrrry slowwwwwwlllllly. I thought this was just how slow everything ran, so I took this into account when timing the guard movements. However, I learned that there was an additional way to test the game on macOS that was not very slow and all of a sudden, the player character had extremely slippery controls and the guards moved at like a million miles an hour. So the game isn't really playable in either state. </p>
